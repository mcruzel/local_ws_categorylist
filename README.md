# local_ws_categorylist

**Webservice function for category list platform**

## Description

The `local_ws_categorylist` plugin is a Moodle plugin that provides a web service to list all available course categories on the platform, including their unique ID (`id`), name (`name`), and full hierarchical path (`path`). The `path` now returns category IDs instead of names, separated by slashes (`/`).

## Features

- **Category List**: Retrieves available course categories on Moodle with the following details:
  - `id`: the unique identifier for the category.
  - `name`: the name of the category.
  - `path`: the complete path of the category in Moodleâ€™s hierarchy, displayed as category IDs separated by `/`.

## Requirements

- **Moodle**: Minimum version required: 3.11.
- **Permissions**: Users must have the `moodle/category:manage` capability to access this service.

## Installation

1. Download the `local_ws_categorylist` folder into the `local` directory of your Moodle installation.
2. Access the site administration to complete the plugin installation.
3. Enable web services in Moodle administration if needed and assign permissions to authorized users.
